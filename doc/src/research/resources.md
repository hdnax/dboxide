# Resources

This section documents the knowledge learnt from various sources during the implementation of `dboxide`:

- [**`rust-analyzer`**](./resources/rust-analyzer/SUMMARY.md): An implementation of LSP for the Rust programming language - a good reference model.
- [**`libsyntax`**](./resources/libsyntax/SUMMARY.md): Rust compiler's crate that documents some design notes on tree structure and parser.
